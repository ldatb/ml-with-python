These are my studying files from the Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction, by IBM, at edX.

You can find the course at: https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-a-practical-introduct

You'll see that from K-Nearest neighbors I started using Jupyter Notebooks, as I saw the benefits of it. In the future I'll convert the .py files to .ipynb, but
my goal now is to finish the course.
