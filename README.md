### These are my studying files from the Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction, by IBM, at edX.

You can find the course at: https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-a-practical-introduct

I recommend viewing the project in this order:
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Non-Linear Regression
4. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
5. Decision Tree
6. Logistic Regression

The first files are pure python because I didn't knew how to use Jupyter Notebooks, from KNN and so on, I decided to search the benefits of Jupyter and decided to use it. In the future I'll update the .py files to .ipynb so it's all regular.
